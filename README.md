## etch-a-sketch
I was super excited to put what I learned about events and DOM manupilation that I learned about into practice, so in repository I will build the etch-a-sketch while referencing the general guidelines in The Odin Project to practice making creating project repositories, working with flexbox, and DOM manipulation using Java Script.

# Live Demo:
Project Link: [Hama's Etch-A-Sketch](https://hamacodes.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

# What I Learned:
- Familiarity with how to start a project repo and set up necessary files
- Practice with version control and how to work on a project and continually push updates using command line interface
- CSS Grid layout and a better understanding of its use cases and proper handling
- Limitations of browser based applications and how optimization strategies will become crucial as runtime complexity goes up
- I am now capable of thinking of a project, planning out what parts it will need, and implementing small parts with vigirous testing
- That I need to be more patient and finish a project fully to be even prouder of my self (sorry this project)

# Final Thoughts:
This project was an exciting one and cool one to show off to friends. I do hope to return to the project and add more functionality (as well as finish some functionality that I may or may not have skipped on). I have played sketching games and now have a much better idea of what everything might look _like under the hood_.
